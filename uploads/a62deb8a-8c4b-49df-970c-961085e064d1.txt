The heart is a muscular organ roughly the size of a fist, located just behind and slightly left of the breastbone. It pumps blood through a network of arteries and veins called the cardiovascular system. The heart has four chambers: two upper chambers (the atria) and two lower chambers (the ventricles). The right side of the heart receives deoxygenated blood and sends it to the lungs; the left side receives oxygenated blood and pumps it to the rest of the body.

The walls of the heart are made of three layers: the outer layer (epicardium), the middle layer (myocardium), and the inner layer (endocardium). The heart is protected by a sac called the pericardium. Its rhythm is controlled by electrical impulses that originate in the sinoatrial node, often referred to as the heart's natural pacemaker.

The heart beats about 60 to 80 times per minute in an average adult, and it pumps roughly 7,200 liters of blood per day. Valves within the heart prevent the backflow of blood and ensure it flows in the correct direction. The tricuspid valve is located between the right atrium and the right ventricle, and the mitral valve is between the left atrium and the left ventricle.

Blood is supplied to the heart muscle itself by the coronary arteries. The venous blood is collected by the coronary sinus, which returns it to the right atrium. The heart is regulated by the autonomic nervous system, particularly by signals from the medulla oblongata. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is crucial for good heart function and overall cardiovascular health.
